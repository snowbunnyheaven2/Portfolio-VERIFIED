<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm <strong>snowbunnyheaven_</strong>, a passionate Minecraft server developer and community growth specialist. I’ve contributed to and managed multiple large servers, focusing on crafting custom Skripts, optimizing gameplay, and building engaged player communities.</p>

<p>I’m also co-owner of <a href="https://cefyr.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cefyr.com</a> — an IT company partnered with Microsoft. Through Cefyr, I leverage professional networks and resources to secure partnerships, sponsorships, and collaborative opportunities for the projects I work on.</p>

<p>I usually get paid for my expertise, but when I see real potential, I’m happy to contribute for free to help servers grow and thrive.</p>

<h2>What I Do</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Skript Development & Optimization:</strong> Creating custom game mechanics like gun systems, PvP kits, queue systems, LMS, KOTH, and more. I focus on smooth gameplay, bug fixes, and fresh features.</li>
  <li><strong>Discord Management & Growth:</strong> Revamping Discord servers to be lively and organized. I build event systems, roles, bots, automations, and moderation tools that boost player interaction and retention.</li>
  <li><strong>Player Growth & Partnerships:</strong> Utilizing my network through Cefyr and Microsoft to advertise, bring in players, and build partnerships or sponsorships to increase server visibility and credibility.</li>
</ul>

<h2>My First Priorities</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comprehensive audit of existing server Skripts and systems to find improvements</li>
  <li>Quick bug fixes and polish for better player experience</li>
  <li>Plan and execute Discord server improvements, including events and bots</li>
  <li>Develop a simple but effective recruitment and player engagement strategy</li>
  <li>Provide clear, regular progress updates for transparency</li>
</ul>
